$ G_{\mu \nu} = 8 \pi T_{\mu \nu} $

### GRMHD simulations of accretion disks

Using GRMHD code I carry out thin disk simulations of accretions disks around a
Black Hole. And then extract the X-ray reflection spectra of the disk.

### Testing General Relativity

Using X-ray and GW data we test the Kerr hypothesis of Astrophysical Black Holes
using various paramterised metrics.

### Simulations of Neutron Stars

Using numerical relativity simulations I study single and binary neutron stars.
