My name is Swarnim Shashank (स्वर्णिम् शशांक -- which translates to golden moon so I also like to write it simply as 金月). I became interested in astronomy through watching numerous documentaries as a child, and then later developed interest in coding in high school. This has now lead me to working in astrophysics research - where I study the astrophysical systems using numerical simulations.

I am currently working on problems related to relativistic astrophysics in the strong gravity regime. My works span both in X-ray and gravitational wave astrophysics. I am currently working as a postodoctoral fellow at the department of Physics at Fudan University.

I have a lot of interests and like discussing science, philosophy, music, movies, food and FLOSS. I play guitar and harmonium, and have a diploma in Hindustani classical music.
