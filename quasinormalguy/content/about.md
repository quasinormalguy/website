My name is Swarnim Shashank (स्वर्णिम् शशांक which translates to golden moon, I also like to write it simply as 金月). I hail from the city Allahabad located in the Gangetic plains of northern India. Although most of my childhood was spent at a very small industrial town some 350 kms away in the foothills of the Vindhya range. I became interested in astronomy through watching numerous documentaries on the Discovery channel as a child, and then later developed interest in coding in high school. This has now lead me to working in astrophysics research.

I am currently working on problems related to relativistic astrophysics in the strong gravity regime. My works span both in X-rays and Gravitational Waves. I am currently working towards my PhD in Theoretical Physics at Fudan University.

I have a lot of interests and like discussing science, philosophy, music, movies and food. I play guitar and harmonium, and have a diploma in Hindustani classical music.
